## Ben's Mini Deep Learning Framework

### Description
I'm building this mini DL framework to get a better understanding of how things work under the hood. This is part of my ongoing efforts to keep my brain *sticky* (or neuroplastic). Your brain is the most important neural network, after all.

## TODO
[] Find some way to write tests for the activation functions
[] Add loss functions
[] Add a network class
[] Add a training loop
[] Add data handling
[] Add evaluation
[] Add optimizers
[] Add regularization
[] Add examples and docs
